SVCraft Audio configuration.

    hearDistance (default: 32)
The distance in blocks you need to be to another player to hear them.

    connectDistance (default: 40)
The distance in blocks you need to be to another player for their audio to
start connecting. Connecting can sometimes take a little bit so therefore
players are connected a bit before the players can actually hear each other.

    disconnectDistance (default: 50)
The distance in blocks you need to be to another player for their audio to
disconnect. This should be set to slightly more than connectDistance to avoid
players disconnecting and reconnecting often when being on the edge of the
connection range.

    updateTaskInterval (default: 20)
The interval in ticks when the update task runs.

    url (default: https://svcraft-audio.alvinn8.repl.co)
The URI of the svcraft-audio website to connect to.

    debug (default: true)
Whether debug mode is enabled.
